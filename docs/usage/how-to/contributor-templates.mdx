Clear, consistent issue and pull request descriptions help maintainers and contributors collaborate efficiently. Our contributor templates standardize what information we need so that:

- Uniformity: every PR, bug, and feature request follows the same structure
- Consistency: key context is captured the same way across submissions
- Speed: reviewers can quickly understand, reproduce, and decide next steps

What we provide

- Pull Request template
  - Canonical: .github/pull_request_template.md
  - Ensures changes are clearly described, verified, and scoped
- Bug report template
  - Canonical: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_template.yml
  - Guides reporters to include repro steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment
- Feature request template
  - Canonical: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md
  - Helps frame the problem, desired outcome, and alternatives considered

How to use

- When opening a PR or Issue on GitHub, the relevant template is pre-filled
- Fill out all required sections; remove any parts that are not applicable
- Provide links, logs, screenshots, and reproduction steps when relevant

Best practices for submissions

- Be specific: include steps to reproduce and exact error messages
- Keep it scoped: one change/request per PR or issue
- Link related issues/PRs and reference documentation
- Run linters/tests when applicable before submitting
